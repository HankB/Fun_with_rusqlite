Fun with Rust and SQLite

## Motivation

I plan to store/retrieve information in an SQLite database as part of a Rust program. Rather than faff around with adding that to the existing program, I'll explore it here and be able to copy the best to the actual project. This work is very much along the lines of "monkey see, monkey do" in that I'll be cribbing heavily from examples I find and tweaking them to be more like what I want.

See the subdirectories `simple/`, `cookbook/` for the actual exercises.
